# PhIP-seq 3D Visualization Dashboard

This platform provides an interactive 3D visualization of PhIP-Seq enriched epitopes mapped onto protein structures (PDB/CIF format), results from the PhIP-Seq pipeline.

## Features

- **Supports PDB and CIF structures**
- **Interactive 3D viewer**
- **Epitope selection**: Select and highlight individual epitopes or view all enriched epitopes.
- **Chain highlighting**: Option to highlight all chains (multimeric structures).

## Usage

- **Select Structure**: Choose a PDB/CIF ID from the dropdown.
- **Select Sample**: Filter epitopes by sample.
- **Background**: Switch between white and black backgrounds.
- **Highlight all chains**: Toggle to highlight epitopes on all chains or just one.
- **Epitope Selection**: Use the dropdown to focus on a specific epitope or view all.
